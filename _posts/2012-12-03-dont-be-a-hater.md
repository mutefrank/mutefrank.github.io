> 100% of haters are unrealized potential ... (for example) Michael Jordan's not a hater, when you get to that level you don't have time to hate.

This is a really important point that [Joe Rogan and Byran Callen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJv5Nc4Hl8k) make, if you're doing something awesome and you're good at it you have no time or desire to point out and pick on the shortcomings of other people - if they're going to fail that's usually obvious and they can manage that by themselves, you don't need to help them along or point it out in a narcissistic way. 

As much as the tech community likes to think that we embrace trying and failure, we still have a horrible culture of putting shit on each other (often on Hacker News or our blogs) - unless someone does something particularly nasty to you personally there is really no need to do this - what is it going to achieve? It seems like every day there is at least one or two posts on HN which are some form of non-constructive criticism about someone else's opinion or project. If you really gave a shit and wanted to help them rather than just trying to grab a little bit of the spotlight, you'd email them privately with something like this:

> Hey John, I noticed you're doing ____, I happened to do that before on a project of my own and if you use _____ instead it will probably save you a ton of headaches. Good luck!

It's as simple as that, it'll take you all of 10 minutes rather than an hour to write a long rant of a blog post and you might actually help the guy rather than publicly put them down. Just think about why you're writing things for a moment before you put (metaphorical) pen to paper.

That concludes my hater-hating rant.
