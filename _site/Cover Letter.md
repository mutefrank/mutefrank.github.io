Cover Letter

To whom it may concern,

I am applying for (what sounds like) a front end developer position, but would be interested in any position you have in Sydney which would suit my skills. I have a fairly broad spread of skills and would be more than willing to learn what is required for the position, given a little bit of time. I am more interested in the enviroment and people I would be working with than the technologies used (although they are still of interest). I feel I would be a good fit to your company's ideals and culture, and your company sounds like the kind of place I would like to be.

I'm 19, proficient in Go, Javascript (jQuery/Zepto, Node, Backbone), Ruby (Sinatra, Rack) and PHP (CodeIgniter, FuelPHP). I have good communication skills and a good attitude, I love coding and building - I'm looking for a group of equally motivated people who love what they do as much as I do to share my time with, make some great stuff and have a good time doing it. I happened to meet two guys from Atlassian (Alex Dickson & Jens Schumacher) while I was in Sydney last weekend at a Github meetup and they seemed like the kind of people I would love to work with every day, I have to assume there are a whole lot of equally talented and smart people where they came from!

My experience is full stack development (working in small teams) mainly with either Ruby/Javascript, Javascript on client and server side (Node and just jQuery or more recently I've played around with Backbone) and maintaining/extending a very large legacy PHP codebase which was not really written with maintainability in mind. I enjoy the challenge of maintaining legacy code, but at times it gets very frustrating.

Although I have completed some university, I ended up deferring to take a development job and went from there - I realise university has much to offer, but I don't think it's for me (at least at this point). I've been coding in many forms for a number of years, some of the time freelancing and more recently working full time.

As well as programming I also enjoy writing and have documented a large amount of aforementioned legacy code internally (as it was contracted some years ago and handed to me as-is), have experience with BDD and unit testing and have worked in an "agile" environment. I also blog occasionally (but would like to make this a more regular occurance).

Right now I'm working for a telecommunications company in Brisbane, but I would be more than willing to relocate to Sydney given the opportunity. If you have any questions about me, or my resume (attached) - feel free to give me a call on 0459194574 or email z@zensavona.com. I look forward to meeting in person.
