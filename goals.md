These are some of my goals for 2012, I'm crossing them off as I go...

### Programming
- decide on a startup idea which is to be pursued seriously
- learn Objective C properly
- learn Meteor and brush up on JavaScript

### Life
- Find a way to quit my job and not work 9-5, I feel I am much more productive when I set my own hours
- decide definitely what I want to do next year
- blog at least twice a week for the remainder of the year

### Fitness
- Benchpress 100kg for 5 reps
- Deadlift 200kg 1 rep max
- be at least 95kg and relatively lean
- Ride a bike (?)

### Projects
- Launch [Platnic][] and run a sucessful nest with real people
