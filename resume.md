My favourite things to play with are Go, Javascript, Ruby and PHP (in that order). I also like messing about with Ardurinos and the like - although my knowlege of hardware hacking is still in it's very infancy, it's a really fun thing to do. I'm a full stack developer and I've learnt bits and pieces of all kinds of things along the way as needed.

I have completed some university but I am mainly self-taught, I've mainly focused on things that interest me but I am very good at picking up new technologies quickly and have proven this over time (having never touched Ruby or any kind of testing before my current position).

## Skills
- Highly proficient with Go and PHP (Codeigniter, FuelPHP)
- Proficient with Javascript (Node, jQuery/Zepto, Chrome APIs, a little Backbone), Ruby (Sinatra, Rack), HTML/CSS, Linux, OS X, Git (In house and hosted on Github - I am used to a pull request centric workflow), Boxgrinder, Chef, Heroku, AWS, B/TDD (Cucumber, Jasmine, PHPUnit, Poltergeist), Jira, MVC, JSON, REST, etc.
- Solid experience taking ownership of a legacy codebase, learning it and extending/updating.
- Expereience with Asterisk, SIP and other PBX technologies.
